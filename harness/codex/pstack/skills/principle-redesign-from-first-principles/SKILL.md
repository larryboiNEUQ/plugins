# Redesign From First Principles

In Codex, read [the Codex adapter](../../docs/harness/codex.md) before following this skill. It overrides Cursor tool names, paths, model selection, and unsupported features below.

When integrating a change, don't bolt it onto the existing design. Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from the start.

- Read all affected files and understand the current design
- Ask: "if we were writing this from scratch with this new requirement, what would we build?"
- Propagate the change through every reference: types, docs, examples, rationale sections
- Think about the whole redesign, then deliver it incrementally

This is the method for preserving option value when integrating changes into an existing design.
